4. Testing with Jest:
Write unit tests using Jest to validate the functionality of bookmarking a job position and ensuring that the toggle button works as expected.
Perform component testing to validate the rendering of the job posting card and job not found card.
5. Testing with Cypress:
Write end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to test the bookmark functionality from a user's perspective.
Create test scenarios that mimic user interactions, such as clicking on the bookmark toggle button, verifying the bookmarked status, and checking if the job position appears in the bookmarked list.
Include assertions to verify the correct behavior of the bookmark feature across different user flows and scenarios.
